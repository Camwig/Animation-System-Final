# Animation-System-Final
The Final Full Implementation of my Animation System

This animation system was created for an assignment in the 4th year of University. It was created using C++, SFML, rapidjson and bullet. It was built and is able to load the sprite and animation data of two-dimensional sprite sheet animation, skeletal sprite animation, three-dimensional mesh animation making use of blend trees which then is able to play an accurate ragdoll animation based of its current animation frame. Then play them back at the correct duration and frame rate. Each type of animation was implemented in accordance with a Skeletal Hierarchical structure, animating each part of skeleton mesh or sprite based on its own transform and the transform of it parents.

The application was developed in accordance with Object Orientated architecture emphasising encapsulation and reusability. In accordance with the aim of the development to create a system that is modular in its usage and reusable.
